  <span>What can I do on NaatCast?</span><br>
  <div id="ans1" style="font-size:14px; color:black; border:1px solid grey; background-color:white; text-align:left; display:none;">NaatCast is a social platform for broadcasting audio message. You can use NaatCast to send audio message to yourself or anyone. You compose your message as text or upload a pre-recorded audio file. NaatCast delivers the message to your recepient mobile number in audio form. Which means your recepient recieves a call and once the call is picked, he/she would listen to the message. No need for Internet connectivity to receive the call, since it's a normal telephone call. NaatCast ensure the recepient does not miss the call by repeating the call at intervals until it's picked up.<br> As a registered user, you can follow other users, and you can be followed. You can broadcast message to your followers, and if you wish, you can receive audio broadcast from those you follow. You can subscribe to any content provider of your choice, and request for audio broadcast from the provider. You can also become an audio content provider, provided you have audio content under our various categories. Currently we have the following categories: Educational, Comedy, Sport, Breaking News, Weather Report, Traffic Report, Market Survey, Entertainment, Hot Gist, Religion, Health and Fitness, Food and Nutrition, Fashion and Beauty, Finance, Security, Auto Care, Pet Care.</div>
