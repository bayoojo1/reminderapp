<ol start="3">
<li>The permissions you give us</li>
</ol>
<p>We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><u>Permission to use content you create and share:</u>&nbsp;You own the content you create and share on NaatCast, and nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to broadcast to your followers and or subscribers whenever you want. To provide our services, though, we need you to give us some legal permissions to use that content.</li>

<p>Specifically, when you broadcast or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights (like text, audio file) on or in connection with our Platform, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content. This means, for example, that if you broadcast a voice recording or text on NaatCast, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (provided you select to show it on your followers or subscribers timeline). Broadcast that are personal to you would never be seen by anyone, and shall not be used by NaatCast for any other purpose not supported by you.</p>
<p>Since the Platform would be used to broadcast personal and sensitive information either to the account owner&rsquo;s timeline or mobile phone, or to follower(s) timeline or mobile phone, NaatCast will not in any way or for any reason share, transfer, rebroadcast any of such information.</p>
<p>You can end this license any time by deleting your content or account. You should know that, for technical reasons, content you delete may persist for a limited period of time in backup copies (though it will not be visible to other users).</p>

<li><u>Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored content:</u>&nbsp;You give us permission to use your name and profile picture next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored content that we display across our Platform, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show your friends that you are interested in an advertised event or have liked a broadcast created by a content provider that has paid us to display its ads on NaatCast. Ads like this can be seen only by people who have your permission to see the actions you've taken on NaatCast.</li>
<p>
<li><u>Permission to update software you use or download:</u>&nbsp;If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install upgrades, updates, and additional features to improve, enhance, and further develop it.</li></p>

<p>
<li><u>Limits on using our intellectual property</u></li>

If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or broadcast on NaatCast), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or&nbsp;trademarks (or any similar marks)&nbsp;as expressly permitted by our&nbsp;Brand Usage Guidelines&nbsp;or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, create derivative works of, decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong> Additional provisions</strong></li>
</ol>
<ol start="1">
<li>Updating our Terms</li>
</ol>
<p>Our consistent effort is to improve our services and develop new features to make our Platform better for you and our users. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Platform.</p>
<p>We hope that you will continue using our Platform, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no longer want to be a part of the NaatCast, you can&nbsp;delete&nbsp;your account at any time.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Account suspension or termination</li>
</ol>
<p>Our goal is to put NaatCast in a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and broadcast their content.</p>
<p>If we determine that you have violated our terms or policies, we may take action against your account to protect other users and maintain the integrity of our Platform, including by suspending access to your account or disabling it. We may also suspend or disable your account if you create risk or legal exposure for us or when we are permitted or required to do so by law. Where appropriate, we will notify you about your account the next time you try to access it. You can&nbsp;learn more&nbsp;about what you can do if your account has been disabled.</p>
<p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Limits on liability</li>
</ol>
<p>All our efforts is to provide the best Platform we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Platform, however, are provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content).</p>
<p>We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Platform. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the NaatCast Platform, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Disputes</li>
</ol>
<p>We intend to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.</p>
<p>If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the NaatCast Platform ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved exclusively in the Nigeria High Court or High Court of Lagos State (Nigeria), that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of Lagos State will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Other</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and NaatCast regarding your use of our Platform. They supersede any prior agreements.</li>
<li>Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our Products for commercial or business purposes, selling products, developing apps, providing content, you must agree to share your income with NaatCast. If you post or broadcast content containing music, you must comply with best international practice. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.</li>
<li>If any portion of these Terms are found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.</li>
<li>You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent.</li>
<li>As much as we would try within our capacity to deliver your broadcast to the targeted recipien(s), we rely on third-party telecoms providers. Even though we've partnered with some of the best telcos, delivery of your broadcast is still on best-effort base.</li>
<li>NaatCast reserves the right to change or update the broadcast rate at any point in time without any notification to users.</li>
<li>These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.</li>
<li>You should know that we may need to change the username and or mobile number for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if someone else claims the username and or mobile number, and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).</li>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But you should know that we may use them without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.</li>
<li>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</li>
